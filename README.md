# Features

AutoSummoners comes with 3 main features : [Auto Lobby](#auto-lobby), [Auto Queue](#auto-queue) and [Auto Champion Select](#auto-champion-select).

## Auto Lobby

The Auto Lobby feature allows users to automate the process of creating a lobby, choosing a specific queue and choosing specific roles.

## Auto Queue

The Auto Queue feature allows users to automatically start matchmaking when their lobby is ready and to automatically accept matches when found.

## Auto Champion Select

The Auto Champion Select allows users to automate the whole champion selection process : 
- Users can create multiple profiles for specific queues/positions with a list of champion to ban and a list of champions to pick  
- AutoSummoner will ban the first champion in the list which is not pre-picked by any ally  
- AutoSummoner will pre-pick and pick the fist champion in the list which is available (not banned or already picked)
- Users can choose specific runes and summoner spells for each champion which will then be selected automatically
